# Changelog

All user-visible changes to Artifact Gateway are recorded in this file.

The project has not published a stable release. Changes are collected under
`Unreleased` using the fixed categories below; a release moves those entries to
a dated version heading without rewriting their meaning.

## Unreleased

### Added

- Role-based `api`, `scheduler`, and `worker` deployments with format- and
  job-specific worker filters.
- PostgreSQL-backed runtime node heartbeats and an administrator inventory of
  node roles and Worker capabilities.
- Server-side aggregate repository management and cross-repository search APIs.
- Per-repository outbound proxy configuration and connectivity checks.
- npm Proxy repositories with verified read-through metadata and tarball
  caching, stale-if-error reads, negative caching, and offline installs.
- npm Group registries that merge Hosted and Proxy package versions with
  Hosted-first conflict resolution, anonymous/grant filtering, and Group-local
  tarball URLs.
- PyPI Hosted, Proxy, and Group repositories with native `pip` upload and
  install flows, normalized project browsing, anonymous/grant filtering, and
  read-through package caching.
- npm and PyPI artifact lifecycle operations covering retention, tombstones,
  restore, object collection, promotion, and replication.

### Changed

- Reduced Console repository request fan-out and split large vendor bundles for
  faster navigation and initial loading.
- Compacted repository detail navigation and added restrained interface motion.
- Streamed artifact uploads and bounded database, HTTP, and background-worker
  resource usage.
- Added package-level Go coverage floors and Console lint, formatting,
  accessibility, component-test, and coverage gates.
- Added session-aware distributed node inventory, graceful offline state,
  retention cleanup, and cluster capability health summaries.

### Fixed

- Resolved public artifact deep links even when the target coordinate is beyond
  the first browse page.
- Fixed PostgreSQL OCI upload expiry scans so scheduled reclaim jobs are
  created and completed reliably across worker instances.
- Stabilized generated OpenAPI output, dependency installation, integration
  readiness, and lifecycle ordering in CI.

### Security

- Updated the Go toolchain and dependency pins used by release-readiness checks.
